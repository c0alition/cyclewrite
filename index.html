              <p>Some trips need a little more priming than others to get going. This trip was definitely one of those.. I've been a bit burnt out from a long race season and I can't quite figure out how to shake it, but a bikepacking trip always seems like a good idea.</p>

I head outside and the sun still hasn't risen yet and it's cold, very cold. It's early April and morning air is still a frosty thirty degrees in the valley. I'm cold, tired, and hungry, but feel a growing rush of adrenaline which can mean on...</p>

              <p>This weekend I decided it was time for a solo trip. I have neglected my race bike for a while and figured it needed some love. I refreshed the Stans, adjusted the derailleur, and replaced a set of worn brake pads. To finish everything off I borrowed a friend's frame bag that would fit my bike...</p>

          <p>Cyclewrite started back in 2015ish as a project to learn PHP, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The idea was to develop a blogging platform for adventure cyclists to post their stories of adventure. While Cyclewrite still remains a learning project, I do plan on having it's functionality fully restored in the near future! I can't wait to read about what bike adventures are happening and hope you're ready to write!</p>
